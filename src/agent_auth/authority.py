"""Canonical grant authority.

`capability` and `scope` on a request are two projections of one thing: the
authority a grant conveys over its `resource`. Each platform puts that authority
in whichever field is ergonomic — Kubernetes in `capability` (the role), GitHub
in `scope` (the permission map) — and leaves the other a constant or empty. That
split is convenient at the edge but dangerous in the middle: security logic
(rule-pinning, the sensitive-capability gate) has to know which field holds the
privilege, and guessing wrong is how a rule pinned to a harmless request ends up
rubber-stamping a dangerous one.

So `authority` is the single stored source of truth. `fold` canonicalizes
(capability, scope) into it; `split` reconstructs the pair for the wire and for
humans. Everything security-critical compares `authority` directly.
